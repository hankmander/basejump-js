# Basejump UI Components

Many of these are taken directly from the Supabase AuthUI library. This is needed because one of the design goals of the
library
is to leverage the same appearance object for styling as Supabase AuthUI. Unfortunately, these components are not
exported from the react library and therefore cannot be used directly.

Open to ideas on how to improve this experience - it may get gross enough that we need to drop the design goal.
