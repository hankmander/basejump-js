# Get started with Basejump

Basejump adds personal accounts, team accounts, invitations and subscription billing to your Supabase project.  Use it as a launching point for your Supabase app, or as a standalone auth API similar to Auth0 or Clerk.

We offer a React UI Kit to help you get started, but you can use Basejump with any frontend framework or platform.
