# Adding your own billing providers

Basejump provides support for Stripe out of the box, but you can add your own billing providers if you need to. Billing providers must support:

- Portal interfaces for customers to manage their subscription or update payment settings
- Subscriptions with support for multiple product plans
- Webhooks for updating subscription status
