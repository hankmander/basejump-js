# ProfileButton

The account select component is a combobox of accounts that the current user belongs to, including their personal account.

The `<ProfileButton />` component is powered by shadcn, meaning the code and all it's components are local to your codebase for easy customization.
The inspiration for the component design was borrowed heavily from the [shadcn dashboard example app](https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/dashboard).

## Installation

This assumes that you've followed the [react or nextjs getting started guide](/docs/react) and have a working shadcn installation.

### 1. Install required shadcn components
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add dropdown-menu
```
