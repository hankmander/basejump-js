# Testing
If you plan to continue building out your app on Supabase, we recommend that you start writing tests for your database.  This will help you catch bugs early, and ensure that your app is working as expected.

To help make testing with Supabase and Basejump easier, we've created a companion library called [supabase-test-helpers](https://github.com/usebasejump/supabase-test-helpers).

## Getting started with pgTAP
If you haven't written tests for your Supabase apps yet, we highly recommend you start! It's not too difficult once you get used to the structure - especially now that the Supabase CLI has pgTAP support built in. [Check out the official guide here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/testing), but we've also included a quick start guide below.

### 1. Install dbdev extension manager
First, [install the dbdev extension manager into your Supabase instance](https://database.dev/installer).

### 2. Installing Supabase Test Helpers
Either add a migration file to your project for the installation, or install it directly into your Supabase instance.

```sql
select dbdev.install('basejump-supabase_test_helpers');
```

### 3. Setting up your Supabase project for testing

```bash
mkdir -p ./supabase/tests/database
touch ./supabase/tests/database/your-first-tests.test.sql
```

## Writing your first test
Now your'e ready to write your first tests.  You can check out a few resources we've pulled together for you to get started:
- [A Guide to testing on Supabase using pgTAP](https://usebasejump.com/blog/testing-on-supabase-with-pgtap) - a blog post we wrote on the topic with commonly used testing formats for your RLS policies
- [Supabase Test Helpers function overview](https://github.com/usebasejump/supabase-test-helpers) - a list of all the functions available to you in the Supabase Test Helpers library
- [Official Supabase testing docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/testing) - a bit lightweight for now, but I suspect these get fleshed out more over time

### Example test
```sql {{title: "./supabase/tests/database/your-first-tests.test.sql"}}
BEGIN;
    -- We activate the extension INSIDE a test so that it's never activated in production
    CREATE EXTENSION "basejump-supabase_test_helpers";
    -- Indicate how many tests we expect to run
    select plan(1);
    -- create users for testing
    select tests.create_supabase_user('test_owner');
    -- create an example post for testing
    insert into posts (title, body, user_id) values ('test post', 'this is a test post', tests.get_supabase_uid('test_owner'));
    -- ensure you're anon
    select tests.clear_authentication();
    SELECT
        is_empty(
                $$ select * from posts $$,
                'Anon cannot select posts'
            );
    select * from finish();
ROLLBACK;
```

## Running your tests
Now that you've written your first test, you can run it using the Supabase CLI:

```bash
supabase test db
```
