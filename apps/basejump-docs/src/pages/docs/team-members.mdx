    'API endpoints for managing account team members in Supabase with Basejump'

# Team members

Team accounts allow you to invite other users to access your account. Members can be assigned different roles, which control what they can do within the account.

## The team member model

Not all endpoints return all account data - particularly around billing as that can require additinoal calls to third parties to verify. Below is a breakdown of fields you can expect to get back when interacting with accounts.

### Properties

<Properties>
    <Property name="user_id" type="uuid">
        Unique identifier for a user.
    </Property>
    <Property name="account_role" type="string">
        The current user's role within the account. Typically `member` or `owner`.
    </Property>
    <Property name="is_primary_owner" type="boolean">
        Tells you if the current user is the primary owner of the account.
    </Property>
    <Property name="name" type="string">
        The name of the user
    </Property>
    <Property name="email" type="string">
        The email address of the user
    </Property>
</Properties>
