# Understanding accounts and roles

Out of the box, we support personal accounts and team accounts.

A good example of this in the wild is Github, where you have your own personal account, but can also create team accounts.

## Personal Accounts
* Created automatically when a user signs up, using the user's ID as the Account ID
* Do NOT support invitations or multiple members
* DO support billing through Stripe

**Personal accounts cannot be disabled**, they are always created. You can choose to ignore them by simply not creating any interfaces for them and disabling billing for them.


## Team Accounts
* Any user can create a team
* DO support billing through Stripe
* DO support invitations and multiple members
* The user who creates the account becomes the `primary_owner`
* `owner` users can manage invitations, users and billing
* `member` have access to accounts, but can not edit them
* `primary_owner` cannot be removed, but you can change the primary owner of an account

To enable team accounts, set `team_accounts_enabled` to true in the `basejump.config` table.

## Team member roles
Basejump provides a set of roles that you can use to configure your permissions. You can also create your own roles if you need to.

* `owner` - Owners have access to everything, including billing and inviting new users
* `member` - Members can access the account, but cannot invite new users or manage billing

### Adding a new role
To add a new role, you need to add it to the `basejump.account_roles` enum value in postgres.  New roles do not have any special permissions by default, any RLS policies defined using basic account member checks will apply to the new role.

```sql
ALTER TYPE basejump.account_role ADD VALUE 'your_new_role';
```
