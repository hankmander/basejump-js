# Deploying Basejump

Once you're ready to go to production, deploying to your Supabase account is easy. This guide assumes that you've already [installed the Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/images/docs/guides/cli)

## Setup your account

Head to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a new project. Make sure you record your database password somewhere secure, you'll need it later.

## Setup the Supabase CLI
In general, you can follow the [official guide](https://supabase.com/images/docs/guides/cli/local-development#deploy-your-project) for up to date info.

### Login to Supabase
```bash
supabase login
```

### Link your project
You can get your project ID on the Settings page of your project. To finish this, you'll need the database password you input when creating your project.
```bash
supabase link --project-ref <project-id>
```

## Run your migrations
You'll need your database password for this step too.
```bash
supabase db push
```

## Deploy your edge functions
The billing portion of Basejump is handled through two edge functions - one for general billing lookups and one for handling provider webhooks.

To deploy them, you'll first add your secrets to production

```bash
supabase secrets set STRIPE_API_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>
supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=<your-stripe-webhook-secret>
```

Then you can deploy the functions
```bash
supabase functions deploy billing-functions
supabase functions deploy billing-webhooks --no-verify-jwt
```
