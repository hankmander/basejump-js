# Basejump React / Next.js Helpers

Basejump is a set of Postgres migrations and edge functions that give you personal account, teams, permissions and billing for Supabase - you don't need anything but the basic installation listed at [usebasejump.com](https://usebasejump.com). However, there are also some convenience methods including data fetching hooks leveraging [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app), Typescript Types and other convenience components.

These helpers are also used inside the copy/paste UI components provided at [usebasejump.com/docs/react](https://usebasejump.com/docs/react) - however you're welcome to refactor them a bit if you want to skip the external dependency.  It wouldn't be too hard.
